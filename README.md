echogit is a python program that synchronize files using git.
this is an alternative to syncthing but much better for me. (but maybe not for you ;).

to work, it requires:
- termux installed.
- permission set on android for echogit-mobile
- installation of echogit on termux
- setup of echogit.sh with execution permission
- ssh keys setup so we can git clone through ssh without password
- understand how files and folder has to be organized for echogit usage
- be confortable with git, ssh and keys

this does the job for me, but this is not ready to be used by anyone.
Not to mention that in case of git conflict, you have to resolve yourself the issue
using git on termux.
